## 📖 About

Mathle was created as part of my Introduction to Python course at Sophia. With 4 years of experience in web design and Python development, I wanted to create something that would make learning math fun and interactive.

Currently, the game focuses on addition problems, but I plan to expand it to include other operations in the future. This project combines my passion for education and clean, user-friendly web design.
